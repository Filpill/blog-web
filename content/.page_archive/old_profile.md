### :telescope: Vision for the Website

The purpose of this website is to document my learning journey and aims to:

> ***Continually build a repository of information to serve as a reference guide for myself and other people in a variety of domains.***

The true value of knowledge is only unlocked when you are deeply interested in the subject matter and are able to conjure solutions to real world problems.

You cannot read random internet articles and then suddenly proclaim *"I have learned the thing!"*. It completely dismisses all the stumbling blocks people typically encounter in the learning process. Be real with yourself. Do not delude yourself into believing passive learning is effective.

***If you are not struggling, you are probably doing it wrong...***

My articles are written to provoke thoughts of how you can use technology in the real world. Experiment with your new found knowledge and apply it in different ways. Revisit those concepts several times before a solid understanding emerges.

I place great value of **writing it down your learning process** as it helps **reinforce and consolidate your new found ideas**. You will be a more grounded thinker and it helps connect previously isolated concepts in order to build bigger and greater things.
