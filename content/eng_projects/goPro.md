## Summary

Designed a skateboard for my GoPro, experimenting with different camera perspectives; in particular with low rolling shots.

The camera mount point is not ideal as the wheels are caught in the field of view...It's not too bad, but still a little bit distracting when shooting a wide angle. It's hard to envision this issue when you are designing it. It's easy to get distracted with the other design elements.

I'm planning to get rid of the clamping device for the camera and use the proprietary universal goPro connector to fix the camera. It will be easier to slide the camera off in the future.

I'm also considering scaling this idea up to a full RC car to make it self-propelling rather than having to manually push the car all the time.

For the time being, this device is just a proof of concept and may evolve in the future.
