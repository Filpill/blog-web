# Summary

Finshed designing and building a functional RC car (which now appears to be more akin to a tractor) which is mostly 3D Printed. 

The reason for the large wheels in the back is because of how I started my design process. The design was built around the gearbox. Since the gearbox ended up being very tall, I figured I would just mount some very large wheels to clear the ground. Therefore I didn't need to think about mounting points for the rear wheel, nor did I need a drive shaft with a CV joint, it was simply direct drive.

I wanted to make my design as simple as reasonably possible. In my previous projects, trying to implement a suspension was fairly complicated and I had limited spare time I had outside of my 9-5. My only goal was to get a suitable functional prototype car.

I did end up using the lessons from my previous failed car designs to incorporate into this one. I had a 2 year hiatus from designing anything mechanical, so I suprised even myself when I managed to get a working 3D printed gearbox for instance.

Not sure what my future plans will be, but I will endeavor to make a more elegant design with improved tolerances. Even after 4 years of 3D printing, its not straightforward to nail down the tolerancing, but at least its at the point of acceptability.
