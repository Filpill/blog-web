### Vision for the Website

The purpose of this website is to document my learning journey and aims to:

> ***Continually build a repository of information to serve as a referenence guide for myself and other people in a variety of domains.***

The true value of knowledge is only unlocked when you are interested and deeply engaged in the subject matter. 

It's not something you can absorb in 10 minute skim read on a random article you googled. Very often, you will have to go deeper into a subject (than initially intended), do some experimentation and revisit ideas multiple times before a solid understanding emerges.

I place great value of **writing it down your learning process** as it helps **reinforce and consolidate your new found ideas**. You will be a more grounded thinker and it helps connect previously isolated concepts in order to build bigger and greater things.
