### Summary

- Designed a 3D printed lithophane lamp in Soldworks.
- Main feature: Replaceable lithophanes of chosen standard of aspect ratio/dimension.

### Features

- Top/Bottom Panels retained with three M3 screws -- Removing the panels gives access to replacing the printed lithophane.
- Wiring threads through back of assembly and socket leans on back the back panel.
- Forward attachment clamps the socket and constrains the foward movement of the light socket with screws.
- I have two slightly different designs to accomadate either an E14 lamp socket or an E27 lamp socket.
- This was due to supply issues of light sockets at the time of design which prompted a redesign due to time constraints.


### Printing and Design

- Images are preprocessed to correct specs and lithophane stl's are generated using: https://itslitho.com"
- Lithophane thickness paramaters:
	- smallest wall thickness 0.9mm
	- largest wall thickness is 3mm
	- border thickness: 5.25mm
- Printed on Creality Ender 3 pro:
	- 0.4mm nozzle
	- Total print time is 26 hours (my printer set-up)

### Animation

- The version shown below in the pictures is the E14 litho lamp:
	- Max Width = 185mm
	- Height = 130mm
