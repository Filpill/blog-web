## üó∫Ô∏è Summary
This article will quickly show you the process of how I obtained the world airspace data using the OpenSky REST API and how I was able to visualise the data. But I will focus on North American airspace since it seems to be the region that captures the most aircraft.

> [Flight Tracking GitHub Project link](https://github.com/Filpill/flight_tracking) is here should you wish to peruse the scripts I've created and get some context of my commentary in this article.

The totality of the airspace depends much maintenance of the OpenSky network. The majority of the data is recorded via ADS-B receivers, which are distributed over the land mass. 

![ADS-B Infographic](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/infiniteflight/original/4X/c/e/8/ce82d1b284d206ad24e395beaf56a63209fbee15.jpeg)

I'm not too well acquainted with aircraft surveillance, but I presume we lose visibility of aircraft (in the data) flying over the sea or mountainous regions outside the range of ground stations. Otherwise it would be interesting to monitor the full flight path across the globe.

Aircraft also require a transponder to retrieve GPS data i.e. communicating between satellites and ground stations. Any flying aircraft with no transponder are not being captured in this view.

I am sure there are more accurate flight data providers selling more accurate views and better coverage, but this is purely an illustrative exercise for curiosities sake.


## üí¨ Data Processing Commentary

I'll go through details of my data collection, storing and processing.

This was a fairly quick and dirty version, however, I still ensured a reasonable folder structure for storing the data. 

Long-term we can look at dumping this info into database like SQLite or Postgres.

### üñºÔ∏è Overall View
The workflow looks something like this:

### ‚è±Ô∏è Procedural Timings 
To put some perspective in time required to process this data:
- It took about **16 hours to make 850 requests** (@60s intervals).
- It takes about **5-10 mins to create all 850 image visualisations with quiver plot**.
- It takes about **20 hours to create all 850 image visualisations with the KDE plot**. 
    - *Not sure why it took so long, i'm pretty sure the script slowed down over time. I was only removing the quiver artist but not the KDE artist (simply by omission). Probably too many chart element variables were being stored in the memory over time.*
- Another **4-7 mins to crops all the white space** from the images.
- **Splicing images takes about 3-5 ish mins** into a neat .mp4.
- And lastly the **video edit takes around 30 mins** to overlay music.

So all in all it takes a full day with the PC running essentially non-stop. And I was manually driving the scripts since I didn't build any monitoring tools in the process.

### üöú Data Collection
The goal here is simple: recursively request and store the aircraft positions in a list individual timestamped csv's. This is how we will build our data repository.

The time delta between each snapshot not too large to lose detail in the movements and not too small to overload the API with requests. The latter is probably more important to consider, because you don't want to bombard the API and risk taking it completely out of commission due to high frequency request intervals.

Something that is important to note is that anonymous users are limited to 80 requests to the OpenSky API per day. This is no good for us since we are trying to make a time lapse over an extended period of time. 

We can circumvent this issue by using rotating IP addresses, since each API call will be distributed over a pool of IP addresses and thus prevent our request timing out (since they can't pin down our real identity).

Though this methodology is typically requires the use of a paid service to provide high quality proxies. In my scenario, I chose to use **OxyLabs** which have a web scrapping proxy tool. You can pipe you Python request via their proxy it will automagically handle the proxies for you. I was able to run my script overnight with not a single failure and retrieved over 850 requests.

Each request produces a 1.1MB csv file. So over 16 hours, we were able to hoover about 1GB of data all together. Unfortunately, my script crashed in the late stages of the execution (probably because I was running it out of a jupyter notebook). I'll convert it into a Python script another time, it just so happens its easier to read the data in Jupyter when doing data exploration.

You may notice also that the git history doesn't have an extensive list of csv data which because there is no real reason to have such a large volume of csv saved on the git history. So it's simply added to the .gitignore and we are storing the files (mostly) locally.

### üìä Data Visualisation

I think the most interesting component to visualising this data is that we are able to clearly see the density of air traffic flying in various airspace. 

We can see common commercial flight routes and we can also see the airport hubs where these air traffic networks are connecting. And there is a multitude of ways to visualise this information, all the way from a contourf plot to a quiver plot. Various 2D visualisations will reveal different information about air traffic behaviour, so it's good to compare and contrast.

Available GPS Data sourced from OpenSky API:
- Longitude
- Latitude
- Speed Bearing
- Various other data points including callsigns.

However, if we are considering a quiver plot, we need to split the speed into its horizontal and vertical components, so we can do some basic trigonometry to figure that out.

In the quiver example below, we see the direction and speed (relative to arrow size) of each individual aircraft. When this data is animated, so can see the arrow get smaller as aircraft slow down on the approach, and grow as they are taking off from the airport. It has a very interesting appearance.

We also can map this out is by creating a scatter distribution and embed the gaussian KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) mapping onto the individual points themselves so we can get a feel for the distribution:

![Gaussian Quiver Plot Airspace](/img/flight/gaussian_scatter.png)                                                                                                                  And we can map the KDE over the entire map itself, however, we must create a "meshgrid" over the plot. The aircraft are between the grids native resolution, therefore we would need to re-shape the data into a 2-dimensional array containing the aircraft density distribution.

We can combine the 2D KDE mapping with the quiver plot to reveal a bit more information on aircraft density distribution, like so:

The plotting process is iterated over the entire folder of timestamped csv's to generate the aircraft movement visualisations incrementally over time.

#### Map Data Struggles
Something that left me completely stumped for a while is that I was not able to directly use the Stadia Maps API within in **Cartopy 0.22.0** which was confusing and frustrating.

I chose to use the **Stadia Maps** API via the Cartopy as it had already build the classes to plug into the API and it had a high contrast map tile that thought was suitable. **But it doesn't work on Cartopy 0.22.0...** It really was a head scratcher for me. After reading the site-packages I realised that the API class I was using was completely defunct within a matter of months.

Although, I discovered a **revised class object sitting (which works) in Cartopy 0.23.0** which was unavailable as a wheel/conda package. So, this was the first time I had to go **build the package from source in the git repo** just for this specific use case. But when they eventually package the final version of 0.23.0 in conda, this issue will no longer be the case...

Although I came across some issues since each API call for the mapping data costs credits to use. And since the map is completely static, it doesn't make sense to make multiple API calls for each set of data from a cost perspective.

Even from a time perspective, it takes a very long time to render the map, about 13s for each snapshot which is way too long. Instead, the process I have created is to only clear the relevant "artists" on the matplotlib figure whilst retaining the map image on the plot. So we can save a lot of time.

Plotting the scatterpoints takes a trivial amount of time in comparison, about 1-2s or so per iteration.

However, plotting the 2D gaussian KDE plot is much more intensive as we are drawing a high resolution color mapping across the entire grid. Each iteration was about 20-25s to render. The filled color grid mapping took about 5 hours to create all 850 images.

Bearing in mind we are purely talking about **single core processing**. If we split the load across the rest of the CPU cores,and spawn the data visualisation processes in parallel, it should cut the time significantly. I'll investigate this setup in the near future to optimise the compute power since Python is pretty slow in general.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Data Animation

And this is the key component where we can physically see how the aircraft are moving over time.

This animation procedure is fairly straightforward when using **ffmpeg**. We can simply point to a folder with a collection of images and ask the program to splice them together into a mp4 file (or whatever file type).

As long as all the images are timestamped, the files should be sorted in chronological order so you don't need to fiddle with passing additional sort arguments into your command.

It only takes a few minutes on my machine to splice together 850 images together.

Since my file structure is segmented into multiple folders partitioned by "date" and "visualisation type", I simply pass those parameters into my bash script to generate the spliced video.

The script is only a few lines and looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# $1 Specifies the Date of the folder to be accessed - E.g. '2024-08-24'
# $2 Specifies the Image Folder To Be Accessed - E.g. 'scatter' or 'quiver' or 'contourf'
# Example of how to run bash script: $(./mkvideo '2024-08-24' 'scatter')

base_folder="$(dirname $(pwd))"
output="$base_folder/animate/videos"
image_data="$base_folder/data/get_states/$1/$2/crop"

ffmpeg -framerate 24 -pattern_type glob -i "${image_data}/*.png" $output/$1_$2_movements.mp4
```

Other video processing I did audio-wise was done on Kdenlive to add in the musical audio transitions.
