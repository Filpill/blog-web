# Summary

- I decided to showcase some data transformations on I game that usually play and see if I could get some cool visualisations/insights.
- I'm using an API to replicate a sample of data visualisations I would typically make.
- In my work I normally query out of a SQL database for my data ingestion but trying something new here as an experiment.
- This was my first time using an API to extract JSON data, but its very easy to manipulate on Python to transform into a dict/dataframe.
