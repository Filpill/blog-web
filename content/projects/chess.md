# Summary

I've played a fair amount of chess on the chess.com platform since 2019 and fortunately all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.

I've was interested in seeing how my rating has changed over time from a graphical perspective.

Though, I didn't make much improvement given that I was playing chess casuallly and was not learning chess strategy in depth.
