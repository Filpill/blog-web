# Summary

I've played a decent number of chess games on the chess.com platform since 2019 and all my chess data can be explored using the API endpoints documented inside the website.

I was interested in monitoring how my rating has changed over the cumalative number of games played.

I was playing chess casually so my improvement was marginal compared to the upper echelon of chess skill. Additionally, I wasn't learning chess strategy or tactics in depth.

Though it was still fun to visualise the progression graphically.
