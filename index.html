				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<ul>
				<li>I'm Filip, a graduate aeronautical engineer with experience predominatantly as a Safety Analyst in the airline industry for the last few years.</li>
				<li>The goal of my projects to develop skills in: analysis, design and programming in combination with my current engineering knowledge.</li>
				<li>The incentive is to steadily improve my engineering proficiency in multiple domains and refine my engineering methodology.</li>
				<li> It goes without saying that you can communicate more coherently with people in other domains and understand each others goals.</li>
				<li>I'll publish new projects as and when they are completed. </li>
				</ul>


				<h2>List of Completed Projects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="filip_UAV.html"</a>UAV Aircraft Design </a>
					<li><a href="filip_PIV.html"</a> Particle Image Velocimetry Dissertation</a>
					<li><a href="filip_HT.html"</a> 2D Heat Transfer Simulation</a>
					<li><a href="filip_3DCar.html"</a> 3D Printed Car (Bluetooth)</a>

			<h2>What Are You Working On Currently?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Designing my own website from scratch: creating HTML and CSS structure to highlight engineering projects.</li>
				<li>Incorporating LaTeX typesetting to create consistent document formatting for report writing with automatic referencing. </li>
				<li>Learning Artix Linux OS, creating work environment and integrating bash scripting to automate repetative tasks.</li>
				<li>Improving programming/document writing efficiency with the Vim text editor and minimising wasted mouse clicks.</li>
				<li>Replicating Excel Statistical Dashboards in Python to automatate statistical reports from other databases.</li>
				<li>Writing PIV Data Post-Processing script in Python to output all desired results from vector field.</li>
				<li>Iterating on previous 3D Printed Car design in alignment with lessons learned in previous design.</li>
			<ul>

			<h2>What Does Your Learning Process Look Like?</h2>
			<ul>
			<li> The clarity of the project depends on a good definition of system requirements and as such my process typically involves reverse engineering from existing end products. </li>
			<li> The work steps and systems are increasing sub-divided to create a clear systematic approach solving each problem without meandering on each issue. </li>
			<li> From time to time it is also necessary to dip back into the engineering fundamentals to develop a stronger understanding of the design process.</li>
			<li> Testing out my ideas through trial and error highlights my deficiencies and serves as guidanace for my learning requirements to improve the soundness of future designs.</li>
			<li> <em> <strong> Ultimately, it is simply a matter of knowing the right sequence of questions to ask yourself.  </strong> </em> </li>
