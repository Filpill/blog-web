	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>I'm Filip, a graduated aeronautical engineer with experience predominatantly as a Safety Analyst in the airline industry for the last few years.</p>


	<p>The goal of my projects to develop skills in: analysis, design and programming in combination with my current engineering knowledge.</p>

	<p>The incentive is to steadily improve my engineering proficiency in multiple domains and refine my engineering methodology.</p>

	<p> It goes without saying that you can communicate more coherently with people in other domains and understand each others goals.</p>

	<p>I'll publish new projects as and when they are completed. </p>

	<p>The links to the projects can be found below:</p>


	<h2>List of Completed Projects</h2>

	<h2>What Are You Working On Currently?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Designing my own website from scratch: creating HTML and CSS structure to highlight engineering projects.</li>
		<li>Incorporating LaTeX typesetting to create consistent document formatting for report writing with automatic referencing. </li>
		<li>Learning Artix Linux OS, creating work environment and integrating bash scripting to automate repetative tasks.</li>
		<li>Improving programming/document writing efficiency with the Vim text editor and minimising wasted mouse clicks.</li>
		<li>Replicating Excel Statistical Dashboards in Python to automatate statistical reports from other databases.</li>
		<li>Writing PIV Data Post-Processing script in Python to output all desired results from vector field.</li>
		<li>Iterating on previous 3D Printed Car design in alignment with lessons learned in previous design.</li>
	<ul>

	<h2>What Does Your Learning Process Look Like?</h2>
	<p> The process is typically reverse engineered from the end product to define the systems and work steps involved. The work steps and systems are further sub-divided to flesh out the problem that is being solved. The clarity of the project improves with better definition of the system requirements. </p>

	<p> Partial attempts to implement ideas are made early on for the intended project. The reason this is done is because it immediately flags your deficiencies and/or lack of understanding. For me, this is the perfect compass for directing your learning requirements.</p>

	<p>The roadblocks encountered along the way are the clearest signal of what you need to do next! It is simply a matter of knowing the right sequence of questions to ask.</p>
