	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>I'm Filip, an Aeronautical Engineer with ambitions in a mixture of engineering fields. The goal of my projects to develop skills in other tools in combination with my current engineering knowledge.</p>

	<p>The incentive is to steadily improve my engineering proficiency in multiple domains and refine my engineering methodology.</p>

	<p> Your knowledge should continually expand and this website serves to demonstrate that it's possible to independantly learn skills such as: programming, web development, mechanical engineering etc.</p>

	<p> It goes without saying that you can communicate more coherently with people in other domains and understand each others goals.

	<p>I'll publish new projects as and when they are completed. The links to the projects can be found below.</p>

<h3>What Does Your Learning Process Look Like?</h3>
	<p> The process is typically reverse engineered from the end product to define the systems and work steps involved. The work steps and systems are further sub-divided to flesh out the problem that is being solved. The clarity of the project improves with better definition of the system requirements. </p>

	<p> Partial attempts to implement ideas are made early on for the intended project. The reason I do this is because it immediately flags your deficiencies and/or lack of understanding. For me personally, this is the perfect compass for directing your learning requirements.</p>

	<p>The roadblocks encountered along the way are the clearest signal of what you need to do next! It is simply a matter of knowing the right sequence of questions to ask.</p>

	<h3>What Are You Working On Currently?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Incorporating LaTeX typesetting to create consistency in document formatting. </li>
		<li>Learning Artix Linux OS, creating work environment and bash scripting.</li>
		<li>Improving document writing efficiency with the Vim text editor.</li>
		<li>Creating this Website, setting up HTML and CSS structure.</li>
		<li>Replicating Excel Statistics Dashboards in Python.</li>
